Example *composite action* written in Go.

## 📄 Project Description

This repository is dedicated to implementing a custom GitHub Action using Go. It serves as a practical example of a composite action, showcasing the steps and considerations involved in creating your own GitHub Actions.

### ✅ What I've Done

- **Objective**: Implement an own action.
- **Process**: Followed the instructions provided in the YouTube tutorial.

### 📂 What It Is

- **Action File**: Contains the action definition within this repository.

### 🚫 What It Is Not

- **Usability**: This action cannot be used outside this repository because:
    - The sources of the action are not included in another repository.
    - The action is not built or packaged for external use.

### 🔄 Current Approach

- **Private Repositories**: Experimenting with different approaches in private repositories to find the most effective method.

## 💡 Recommendations

- **Best Starting Point**: For those new to GitHub Actions, starting with the JavaScript example action is recommended.
